### 1_data_collection.ipynb
We extract data mostly from [AZLyrics Song Lyrics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/albertsuarez/azlyrics) with addition of RAP lyrics from [Hip-Hop Encounters Data Science Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/rap-lyrics) and FOLK and BLUES lyrics from https://www.musixmatch.com.
As the data only contains the artist, song name and lyrics, we extraxt additional imformation on the song genre using [Musixmatch API](https://developer.musixmatch.com) 

Data is tokenized, filtered with simple euristics and split into train and test with no artist overlap between splits to avoid overfittig.


### 2_features.ipynb
To train a classifier we extract several features that capture different types of information from the text:
1. **Surface information:**
  - ```length_in_words``` is ...
  - ```string_mean_length``` is ...
2. **Syntactic information:**
  - ```mean_depth``` is ... 
3. **Semantic information:**
  - ```swear_words``` is ...
  - ```slang```  is ...
  - ```ne_ratio``` is ...
  - ```type_token``` is ...
  - ```ngram_ratio``` is .... where $n \leq 3$
  - ```pronouns_first_to_second``` is ...
  - ```pronouns_self_to_nonself``` is ...
  - ```NOUN``` is ...
  - ```VERB``` is ...
  - ```ADJ``` is ...
